        "\n",
        " Dictionaries in Python store data as key-value pairs, allowing efficient data retrieval. Here's a breakdown of how they work:\n",
        "\n",
        "Hash Table Structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries use a hash table to store key-value pairs. A hash table is an array-like data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hash Function:\n",
        "\n",
        "When a key is added to the dictionary, the hash function computes a unique integer (hash) for the key. This hash determines the index where the key-value pair is stored in the hash table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Buckets:\n",
        "\n",
        "The hash table consists of multiple \"buckets,\" each of which can store multiple key-value pairs. Buckets help handle collisions, where different keys might produce the same hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "Collision Handling:\n",
        "\n",
        "Collisions are managed using techniques like chaining (storing multiple key-value pairs in a single bucket using linked lists) or open addressing (finding another empty bucket in case of a collision).\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic Resizing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries dynamically resize the hash table to maintain efficiency as the number of key-value pairs grows. When the load factor (number of entries divided by the number of buckets) exceeds a certain threshold, the hash table is resized, and the key-value pairs are rehashed.\n",

        "Q5 Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",

        "Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because they do not maintain the order of elements based on their insertion sequence. Instead, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, which store key-value pairs based on the computed hash of the keys. Here’s how this impacts data retrieval:\n",

        "Why Dictionaries Are Unordered:\n",
        "# Hash Table Implementation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries use hash tables to store key-value pairs. The hash function computes a unique hash for each key, which determines the index where the key-value pair is stored. The order of elements in the hash table depends on their hash values, not on the order of insertion.\n",

        "# Efficient Lookups:\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary goal of dictionaries is to provide fast lookups, insertions, and deletions. This is achieved by hashing keys and accessing values directly using their hash values, which sacrifices maintaining the insertion order.\n",
